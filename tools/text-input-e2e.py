"""End-to-end test of Cordial's Roblox text editor, with real keys.

Why this exists rather than `tools/text-entry-check.sh`, which already tests
typing: that script asserts on the *path* -- a spec arrived, the editor was
placed somewhere with a size, the client survived -- and leaves "did the right
characters end up in the box" to a human looking at a screenshot. Every failure
this project has actually shipped in the text editor would have passed it. A
guard that inserted every character twice, a select-all that silently destroyed
the selection, a click that put the caret in the wrong place: all of them leave
a live client with a correctly placed editor.

Three instruments here are different from that script's, and each replaces one
that could not see a failure:

  * **sway, not cage.** cage advertises no `zwp_text_input_manager_v3` and its
    seat never gains a keyboard. Cordial reads seat capabilities once, at
    `open()`, so under cage it never binds its own `wl_keyboard` -- and the
    guard that stops GDK and Cordial both inserting the same character never
    runs. `docs/NEXT.md` labelled that guard `INFERRED` for exactly this
    reason.

  * **A virtual keyboard that is held open from before the client starts**, so
    the seat looks like a real one for the whole run and that guard is under
    test. `wlrctl` creates its keyboard and exits in the same breath, which is
    a race it sometimes wins.

  * **The `textbox` devctl verb**, which reports what the field actually
    contains. There was no readback at all before: the editor's change signal
    prints nothing, the `text ->` trace prints a byte count, and
    `cordial_screenshot` photographs the engine's swapchain, which cannot see a
    GTK widget.

Input is driven inside a nested compositor on its own `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, which
is the one form AGENTS.md permits -- never at the developer's session.
