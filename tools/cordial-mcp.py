"""Cordial Development MCP -- drive and inspect a running Cordial from an agent.

Why this exists, in one paragraph, because it is the whole justification:
debugging Cordial has been bottlenecked on instruments rather than on
reasoning. On 2026-08-21 a rendering bug consumed most of a session and every
wrong turn in it came from a broken measurement -- `mainWorkCallback` read as a
per-frame heartbeat when it fires exactly twice in healthy runs too,
`onFlagsLoaded`'s byte count taken for a delivery readout when it is a
constant, present counts collapsing to 1.0/s from the idle throttle whenever
input was not being driven. Worse, nothing on the host could photograph a
Wayland window at all, so every visual check ended with a human being asked to
look at the screen and describe it. This server closes both gaps: it takes
screenshots out of Cordial's own swapchain, it drives Cordial's own input, and
it attaches a debugger.

What it deliberately does not do. There is no semantic access to Roblox's UI --
no "click the Play button", no element tree. That is not squeamishness: Roblox
exposes no accessibility tree on Android, measured four ways on 2026-08-21 and
recorded in `native/accessibility.cpp`, so there is nothing to read; and
obtaining one would mean engine introspection, which ADR-001 and ADR-003 place
permanently out of scope. This works in coordinates and pixels, which is what a
human tester has.

Input never goes through the compositor. `XTestFake*`, `ydotool`,
`wlr-virtual-keyboard` and the RemoteDesktop portal all land on whatever has
focus, which is the developer's own session, and one of them has already
hijacked a cursor mid-session. Every call here goes to Cordial's own
`input::pass_*` entry points through its control socket.

Run Cordial with `CORDIAL_DEV_CONTROL=1` and point this at the profile:

    tools/cordial-mcp.py --profile-root ~/.local/share/cordial

Speaks MCP over stdio with no third-party dependencies, because a debugging aid
that needs its own virtualenv is one more thing to be broken when you are
already stuck.

    lldb terminates a stack silently rather than reporting that it could not

    On 2026-08-22 that nearly cost the diagnosis of a live freeze: every thread
    came back as

        frame #0: libc.so.6`__syscall_cancel_arch_end

    and nothing else. The engine was deadlocked between `AudioDevice::close`
    and PipeWire's thread loop, which is only visible three frames up.

    The cause is specific, and worth writing down because "lldb is broken" is
    the wrong lesson. lldb unwinds libc perfectly well from an ordinary
    address: a `sleep(300)` stopped at `__internal_syscall_cancel+126` gives
    five correct frames, one more than gdb managed on the same process. What
    it cannot do is unwind from `__syscall_cancel_arch_end+0` -- a bare,
    zero-size label marking the end of the cancellable-syscall region. At
    offset zero of a symbol with no size there are no function bounds and so no
    unwind plan, and the walk stops. gdb gets past it on its own heuristics.

    Neither debuginfod nor glibc debuginfo is the difference: gdb reports
    debuginfod off, this host has no glibc debuginfo installed, and gdb still
    unwound from `.eh_frame` alone.
