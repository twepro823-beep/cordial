//! A development control surface: a socket that drives Cordial's own input and
//! captures its own framebuffer, so an agent can test the client without a
//! human at the keyboard.
//!
//! This exists because of what debugging Cordial actually costs. On 2026-08-21
//! a rendering bug took most of a session and every wrong turn in it was an
//! instrument failure rather than a reasoning failure: `mainWorkCallback` was
//! read as a per-frame heartbeat when it fires exactly twice in healthy runs
//! too, `onFlagsLoaded`'s byte count looked like a delivery readout and is a
//! constant, and present counts collapse to 1.0/s from the idle throttle
//! whenever input is not being driven. Meanwhile nothing here could screenshot
//! a Wayland surface at all -- five methods were tried and all five were
//! refused by the compositor or the kernel -- so every visual check ended with
//! a human being asked to look at the window and describe it.
//!
//! **Two rules shape the whole design, and both come from AGENTS.md.**
//!
//! Input is delivered by calling Cordial's own `input::pass_*` entry points,
//! never by synthesising events at the compositor. `XTestFake*`, `ydotool`,
//! `wlr-virtual-keyboard` and the RemoteDesktop portal all land on whatever
//! has focus, which is the developer's session, and one of them has already
//! hijacked a cursor mid-session. Cordial *is* the client, so there is nothing
//! to send through: the calls go straight in.
//!
//! And nothing here reads Roblox's internal state. The engine publishes no
//! accessibility tree -- measured on 2026-08-21, four ways, all negative; see
//! `native/accessibility.cpp` -- so there is no semantic element list to offer
//! and obtaining one would mean engine introspection, which ADR-001 and
//! ADR-003 place permanently out of scope. This surface works in coordinates
//! and pixels, which is exactly what a human tester has.
//!
//! Off unless asked for. The socket is created only when `CORDIAL_DEV_CONTROL`
//! is set, it lives inside the profile directory so ADR-012's one-instance
//! rule covers it, and no plugin can reach it: ADR-007 gives plugins effects
//! rather than channels, and a socket that drives input is precisely the
//! channel ADR-003 exists to prevent.
