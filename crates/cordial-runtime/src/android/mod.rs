//! Thirty-two functions across four groups, all currently stubbed except assets:
//!
//! | Group | Functions | State |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `AAsset*` | 6 | implemented — see [`asset`] |
//! | `ANativeWindow_*` | 10 | implemented over a host window — see [`window`]/[`wayland`] |
//! | `ALooper_*` | 7 | implemented over epoll — see [`looper`] |
//! | `AConfiguration_*` | 9 | implemented — see [`config`] |
//!
//! The order is not arbitrary: assets gate everything, because the engine cannot

    // exactly twice a session, so Roblox believed it was focused the whole
    // time and kept simulating at full rate behind whatever you had switched
    // to. See `looper::pump`'s own comment.
    //
    // But a user reports that clicking Join and alt-tabbing away *before the
    // game finishes loading* leaves WASD dead for the rest of the session,
    // while the menu and Shift+F5 still work -- and that the same test on
    // Sober does not reproduce. Sober is the interesting half: it is the same
    // engine on the same machine, and the difference we know of is that it
    // almost certainly never reports focus loss, because that is where Cordial
    // was until recently too.
    //
    // Everything else plausible has been ruled out by measurement rather than
    // argument: the engine imports no `AConfiguration_getKeyboard`, jnivm's
    // gap register says "nothing went unanswered this run" for a full session,
    // and `init_params.cpp` already reports the desktop profile Roblox would
    // want -- `kTouchscreenNoTouch`, `kKeyboardQwerty`, `kHardKeyboardHiddenNo`.

    // treats as leave-the-last-state-alone, so this reproduces the old
    // behaviour precisely rather than approximating it. That makes it a real
    // A/B: same binary, same session, flip the variable.
    //
    // **This is a diagnostic, not the fix.** If it turns out to be the cause,
    // the answer is to stop reporting focus loss *while the game is still
    // loading* rather than to stop reporting it at all -- giving up the CPU

    //
    // This used to read `(Some(true), Some(false)) => Some(false)`: a window the
    // compositor said was focused but not visible was reported to the engine as
    // unfocused. `visible()` is `xdg_toplevel`'s SUSPENDED or MINIMIZED, and the
    // intent was to stop simulating behind something -- reasonable, and wrong in
    // one specific way that matters more than the saving.
    //
    // Focus is only ever reported on a *transition*. So a `false` manufactured
    // from a SUSPENDED that the compositor never clears can never be taken back:
    // the engine gets APP_CMD_LOST_FOCUS, stops drawing, and no later
    // APP_CMD_GAINED_FOCUS is ever sent because, as far as this function is
    // concerned, nothing changed. The window stays on screen, plainly focused,
    // and dead.
    //
    // That is what the engine's own log shows on a client frozen for eleven
    // minutes -- found by reading `appData/logs/*_Player_*.log`, which Cordial
    // writes every run and which nothing here had ever looked at:
    //
    //     t=13.08  nativeActivity_onSurfaceChanged: state:7
    //     t=13.09  APP_CMD_WINDOW_REDRAW_NEEDED
    //     t=17.33  APP_CMD_LOST_FOCUS
    //     (then six hundred seconds of nothing but flag-cache timers)
    //
    // The 17 s matters: presents drop to the 1.0/s idle throttle at about
    // thirteen seconds, so the loss lands on an already-quiet engine and takes
    // it to zero. An earlier scripted test that dropped focus at 3.9 s appeared
    // to disprove all of this, because at 3.9 s the engine is still in its 60/s
    // startup phase and carries on drawing regardless. The artificial test was
    // measuring a different moment than the bug.
    //
    // So focus now means focus. An occluded window may keep simulating, which
    // costs CPU that was worth reclaiming; a window that can never be told it
    // has focus again costs the whole session. `backend_visible` is unchanged
