//! The native Wayland backend.
//!
//! [ADR-011](../../../../docs/adr/ADR-011-wayland-and-libadwaita.md) makes
//! Wayland the target and X11 the diagnostic fallback. `window.rs` dlopens
//! libX11 rather than linking it, so the loader and asset tests still run
//! with no display at all; this file follows the same rule for
//! `libwayland-client.so.0`, `libwayland-egl.so.1` and `libxkbcommon.so.0`.
//!
//! ## One hand-written protocol table is left, and that is one too many
//!
//! `wl_proxy_marshal_flags` needs a `wl_interface` table to know how many
//! arguments a request takes and of what type, and the core protocol's tables
//! are compiled into `libwayland-client.so` and exported as data symbols —
//! `dlsym` reaches them the same way it reaches `XOpenDisplay` in `window.rs`.
//!
//! This file used to hand-write two protocols that nothing exports, because no
//! `wayland-protocols` XML was available to generate from. `xdg_shell` is now
//! gone: GTK owns the `xdg_toplevel`, and the subsurface role this file uses
//! instead is core protocol. `text-input-unstable-v3` is still hand-written,
//! and is the one interface below whose event count is this file's assertion
//! rather than the library's — see the note on its live bug further down, and
//! notice that the failure mode it shows is precisely the failure mode a
//! hand-written table has.
//!
//! **Do not add another.** A signature that is wrong by one argument makes
//! `wl_proxy_marshal_flags` read the wrong number or type of variadic
//! arguments and corrupts the wire, and this file's comments record a crash of
//! exactly that family. If a further protocol is genuinely needed
//! here, generate it — or take it from GTK, which is in the process now.
//!
//! **Two more were added anyway, and this paragraph is the justification owed
//! for it.** `pointer-constraints-unstable-v1` and
//! `relative-pointer-unstable-v1` are what a locked pointer is made of, and
//! neither of the two escapes above was open. Taking them from GTK does not
//! work: `nm -D` on this host's `libgtk-4.so.1` exports no
//! `zwp_pointer_constraints_v1_interface`, and `strings` finds neither
//! interface name anywhere in the library, so GDK4 does not speak either
//! protocol and has no table to borrow. Generating them needs
//! `wayland-protocols`' XML, and this host has no `/usr/share/wayland-protocols`
//! at all — a build-time dependency on a package the developer does not have
//! installed is a worse trade than four small tables.
//!
//! So the mitigation is the one the failure above actually calls for. Every
//! signature below was taken from `wayland-scanner private-code` run over the
//! upstream XML and copied from its output rather than written from the
//! protocol description, all four interfaces are version 1 with no `since`
//! prefixes to get wrong, and `pointer_constraints_tables_match_wayland_scanner`
//! in the tests pins each signature string and every count against what that
//! generator emitted. That is a weaker guarantee than generating at build time
//! and a much stronger one than reading the XML and typing what it seemed to
//! say.
//!
//! ## The engine's surface is a subsurface, not a toplevel
//!
//! This file used to give the engine an `xdg_toplevel` of its own, which made
//! the engine's canvas *the whole window*: no titlebar, no client-side
//! decorations, and nowhere to put anything of Cordial's beside the canvas.
//! ADR-011 already said the window is GTK4 + libadwaita and that the shell's
//! window and this one "are the same window"; a bare toplevel here was the
//! part that had not caught up.
//!
//! So GTK owns the toplevel now — [`cordial_shell::host_window`], the same
//! definition the shell binary uses — and the engine's `wl_surface` is a
//! `wl_subsurface` of it, positioned over the window's content area.
//! Consequences worth knowing before changing anything here:
//!
//! GTK's `wl_display` is the *only* connection in the process. Wayland object
//! ids are scoped to the connection that made them, so a subsurface cannot
//! parent to a surface on another one; `open` takes GDK's display rather than
//! calling `wl_display_connect`, and Mesa is handed the same pointer (see
//! `egl_get_display`, whose comment on the second-connection hazard now
//! applies to GDK's connection rather than to one of this file's own).
//!
//! `wl_subsurface.set_desync` is not optional. A subsurface starts
//! *synchronised*, meaning its commits do not take effect until the parent
//! commits — the engine would present frames that appear only when GTK
//! happened to repaint, which for a static window is never.
//!
//! `set_position` is the mirror image: it *is* latched on the parent's commit,
//! so moving the canvas needs GTK to repaint afterwards
//! (`HostWindow::queue_commit`).
//!
//! Input is filtered by surface. Cordial's `wl_pointer` is a second pointer
//! object on the same seat as GDK's, so it sees `enter` for the header bar
//! too; forwarding those to the engine would have it react to clicks on the
//! window controls. `pointer_enter` records which surface the pointer is on
//! and nothing is delivered unless it is the engine's.
//!
//! ## A web-view dialog is invisible by default, and this is why
//!
//! **Reported as "opening the server browser turns the whole window
//! white/blank", and it is neither white nor blank.** A first pass at this
//! screenshotted a nested compositor and saw the real page, no engine canvas
//! in the way, and wrote up "does not reproduce" -- wrong, and wrong for a
//! reason worth naming: a nested compositor gives every one of
//! its clients its own fresh stacking order, so the bug this file has cannot
//! show up inside one. The tenth instrument fault of this kind recorded here;
//! see AGENTS.md and `docs/adr/ADR-011-wayland-and-libadwaita.md`'s own list.
//! Confirmed instead by the maintainer, on the real desktop, undialled.
//!
//! The actual mechanism is `wl_subsurface` stacking, and it is exactly what
//! this file already says about `get_subsurface`: the engine's canvas is
//! "positioned over the window's content area". A newly created subsurface's
//! default z position is immediately above its parent, and nothing in this
//! file ever moved it -- `grep` for `place_above`/`place_below` before this
//! change found neither. An `AdwDialog` is not a second `xdg_toplevel`; per
//! `cordial_shell::webview`'s own module doc it "draws inside its parent's
//! own surface", meaning inside GTK's *toplevel* `wl_surface` -- the very
//! surface the engine's subsurface sits in front of by default. So the
//! moment a web-view dialog opens, it is painted correctly, into a surface
//! that is there, and then the engine's own canvas -- still compositing
//! above it every frame -- covers it completely. What the user sees is the
//! engine's ordinary rendering, blank because Roblox itself stops drawing
//! its own content once it believes a web view is covering it (the
//! maintainer's own diagnosis, and the reason "blank" rather than "white" is
//! the more precise word).
//!
//! The fix is [`WaylandWindow::webview_dialog_opened`] /
//! [`WaylandWindow::webview_dialog_closed`]: `place_below`/`place_above` the
//! engine's subsurface against `parent_surface` for exactly as long as at
//! least one dialog is open, reference-counted rather than a bare flag so a
//! second dialog opening while the first is still up cannot re-lower an
//! already-lowered canvas, and closing one of two cannot raise it back too
//! early. **Never leave it lowered permanently** -- it is above by default
//! for the ordinary case, which is Roblox running with no dialog open, and a
//! permanently-lowered canvas would be invisible then instead.
//!
//! Like `set_position`, `place_above`/`place_below` are requests on the
//! *subsurface* but are double-buffered on the *parent's* next commit (the
//! Wayland protocol XML says so explicitly for reordering requests, the same
//! paragraph that says it for `set_position`). `set_engine_stacking` follows
//! `sync_canvas_geometry`'s own fix for that -- `HostWindow::queue_commit`
//! plus an explicit `wl_surface.commit` on `parent_surface` right here,
//! because asking GTK to redraw is not the same as GTK having redrawn (see
//! `sync_canvas_geometry`'s "issue #7" comment for the full account of why
//! the direct commit is the one that is not optional).
//!
//! ## `zwp_text_input_v3` had a version-2 event table written to version 1
//!
//! **Correction to what this comment used to say.** It recorded `interface
//! 'zwp_text_input_v3' has no event 8` as a live bug and explained it as
//! "event 8 exists in `zwp_text_input_v2`", a different protocol. That is
//! wrong, and the real explanation is entirely inside this file.
//!
//! `zwp_text_input_v3` **version 2** — which is what GNOME 50's mutter
//! advertises, and what the `bind` below has always asked for — adds three
//! events to the six version 1 has: `action` (6), `language` (7) and
//! `preedit_hint` (8). Event 8 is `preedit_hint`. The table here declared six.
//! An object's version on the wire is inherited from the object that created
//! it, and nothing about passing a smaller number to `wl_proxy_marshal_flags`
//! changes what the compositor believes it may send — so binding the manager
//! at 2 and describing the child at 1 asks for events this file then cannot
//! receive.
//!
//! Measured on the wire, `WAYLAND_DEBUG=1`, before the fix:
//!
//! ```text
//! wl_registry#107.global(26, "zwp_text_input_manager_v3", 2)
//!  -> wl_registry#107.bind(26, "zwp_text_input_manager_v3", 2, new id [unknown]#74)
//!  -> zwp_text_input_manager_v3#74.get_text_input(new id [unknown]#71, wl_seat#103)
//! zwp_text_input_v3#71.enter(wl_surface#47)
//! ```
//!
//! Note the last line: the compositor starts talking to this object as soon as
//! the toplevel takes keyboard focus, with no `enable` sent and no field
//! clicked. There is no window in a session where it is dormant.
//!
//! The failure that follows is *not* a protocol error and this is worth being
//! precise about, because a wrong errno sends the next person somewhere else.
//! Reproduced standalone against this same compositor, by binding `wl_seat` at
//! version 8 behind a deliberately one-event table:
//!
//! ```text
//! interface 'wl_seat' has no event 1
//! roundtrip=-1  wl_display_get_error=11 (Resource temporarily unavailable)
//! ```
//!
//! libwayland refuses the event, puts the *whole display* into a permanent
//! error state, and leaves `errno` at whatever it was — 11, not 71. Every
//! client on the connection stops, which is the freeze. A `wl_display.error`
//! sent by the compositor is the other thing, gives 71 (`EPROTO`), and prints
//! `<interface>#<id>: error <code>: <reason>` first.
//!
//! The rule this file already applied to `wl_pointer`/`wl_keyboard` is the fix,
//! plus its converse: declare the complete event set for the version bound, and
//! never bind above the version whose table is written here. `bind` now takes
//! its version from `TEXT_INPUT_MANAGER_INTERFACE.version` so the two cannot
//! drift apart when wayland-protocols ships a version 3.
//!
//! One thing established earlier and still true, from `WAYLAND_DEBUG=1`:
//! bringing GTK into the process does not add a second text-input object.
//! There is exactly one `get_text_input` on the connection and it is this
//! file's, because GDK creates its own only when a GTK text widget takes
//! focus, and this window has none. That stops being true the moment anything
//! focusable-and-editable is added to the window — two `zwp_text_input_v3`
//! objects on one seat from one client would be a new and much harder bug, and
//! whoever adds an editor widget here has to resolve which of the two speaks
//! for Cordial before doing it.
//!
//! **That happened on 2026-08-25, and the answer is GTK's.** The overlay is now
//! a real `gtk::Text` placed on the focused box, so GDK does create a second
//! `zwp_text_input_v3`, and this file's is no longer enabled while a box has
//! focus -- see `sync_ime_focus`. The widget is the one holding the text, the
//! caret rectangle and the surrounding context, which is everything an input
//! method is given in order to do its job, so it is the one that should have
//! them. This file's object still exists and still receives `enter`; it is
//! simply dormant, and is kept rather than destroyed so that whether two of
//! them on one seat is tolerated stays a question this can answer by running.

        // 2026-08-03: at t=44 the password field is clicked, the username box

        // **It is also not Sober's NVIDIA text-renderer bug**, which is what
        // this comment said for one commit. Sober #1845 and #1026 are real and
        // are a different fault: NVIDIA on Sway, DWL, Niri or Hyprland, fine on
        // KDE Plasma on the same system, answered by Sober's own maintainer
        // with an opt-in `SOBER_FORCE_NEW_TEXT_RENDERER`. Intel under Mutter is
        // on the working side of every one of those correlations, so citing
        // them here was an attribution to the first neighbouring bug that
        // looked similar. Left written down because it is the kind of wrong
        // answer that is easy to reach twice.
        //
        // What changed between the 2026-08-03 measurement and the report is
        // this overlay: back then nothing was drawn during editing and the
        // engine's blur-time rendering was the only rendering there was. The
        // suspicion is therefore that something on the blur path clears the
        // engine's copy -- `connect_editor_changed` guards against exactly that
        // by returning when no box has focus, so if it is that, the guard is
        // losing a race rather than missing.
        //
        // Unmeasured. `CORDIAL_TRACE_TEXT=1` across focus, type, blur settles
        // it: an empty `syncTextbox` going out at blur means the text is being
        // cleared, and no such call means the engine has it and stopped
        // drawing it.
        //
        // The spec is the geometry Android would style a real EditText with, and
        // it arrives either as `showKeyboard`'s NativeTextBoxInfo or from a
        // remembered `<init>`.
        //
        // **This used to say "on the sign-in page neither fires", and that is
        // no longer true.** It was true when it was written, and it stopped
        // being true when the `<init>` hook was corrected to the dex's real
        // fifteen-argument signature: the spec was always being constructed,
        // Cordial was simply not capturing it, so `spec_known` was false and
        // the page looked as though it volunteered nothing. Measured on
        // 2026-08-25 on a fresh signed-out profile, the username field arrives
        // here as `x=470 y=264 w=340 h=22` and the password field as
        // `x=470 y=330 w=304 h=22`, both from `showKeyboard`, both correct on
        // a composited screenshot. The old sentence survived the fix that
        // falsified it, which is the ordinary way a comment starts lying.
        //
        // **Asking the engine directly helps on some pages and not others, and
        // this used to say only the half of that which was measured first.**
        // `nativeGetTextBoxInfo` returned null for the whole of the sign-in
        // page over three runs -- taken before that hook fix, and not re-run
        // since, because `showKeyboard` now answers first there and the getter
        // is never reached. Treat it as history rather than as a current
        // reading. For the search modal,
        // the box that arrives here with `w=0 h=0`, the same call returns real
        // geometry about a second later: `x=596 y=10 w=42 h=0` on the pump tick
        // after focus, then `x=332 y=10 w=592 h=36` at one second and for the
        // rest of the box's life, twice out of two runs on 2026-08-25 with
        // identical numbers. So the engine has the geometry; what it does not
        // have is the geometry at the moment it volunteers a spec.
        //
        // Hence the order below: `showKeyboard` first because it is exact and
        // free, the getter second and only when the first is unusable, the
        // fallback bar third and only when neither answered. See
        // [`Self::polled_textbox_info`] for the rate limit and why it is 10 Hz.
        //
        // **The fallback below is now a safety net nothing currently lands
        // in, and it stays.** Every box tried on 2026-08-25 -- the home search
        // bar, the search modal it opens, the sign-in username and password
        // fields -- is placed from real geometry by one of the two sources
        // above. No box is known that supplies neither. That is a reason to
        // keep the net rather than to remove it: it has been reached before,
        // the set of boxes here is not the set of boxes Roblox ships, and the
        // failure it catches is invisible typing, which is the bug this whole
        // path exists for. It is untested as of that date and should be
        // treated as such.
        //
        // So when there is no spec, place the editor ourselves rather than
        // abandoning it. It will not sit exactly over the box, and that is the
        // honest trade: a legible bar in a fixed place beats invisible typing,
        // and the alternative on offer -- reusing the previous box's numbers --
        // is the one `android_classes.cpp` already refuses, because an editor
        // styled from a stale spec looks like a layout bug rather than a missing
        // value.
        // **A zero-sized spec is not geometry, and it is worse than none.**
        //
        // Roblox hands out both. Clicking the home search bar gives
        // `x=516 y=10 w=358 h=36`, which is exactly where that bar is; the
        // search modal it opens then reports `x=0 y=0 w=0 h=0`. Taking the
        // second at face value places a 0x0 editor -- present, correct, and
        // invisible -- and, worse, it looks like a real spec so the fallback
        // never runs. Found by `tools/text-entry-check.sh` on its first pass,

// of the window. Both are the same missing mechanism: `zwp_pointer_constraints_v1`
// to stop the cursor moving, and `zwp_relative_pointer_v1` to keep being told
// how far it tried to.
//
// **The escape path is the part to be careful with.** A lock this file takes
// and does not give back is not a bug in a game client, it is the developer's
// own desktop with a cursor they cannot move, and it has to survive Cordial
// misbehaving rather than only Cordial behaving. There are four ways out and
// they are deliberately independent: the button coming up, the engine saying it
// no longer wants it, Escape (which also latches the lock off until whatever
// asked for it stops asking), and the process ending — the compositor releases
// a constraint when the client that made it goes, so even a kill returns the
// cursor.

///
/// Distinct from "Cordial asked for one", which is `locked_pointer` being

    // this function used to avoid by never acting on unlocked motion at all.
    //
    // Nothing here assumes `wl_pointer.motion` and this event arrive in a
    // particular order. The relative-pointer extension's text does not specify
    // one, so a compositor is free to write either object's event to the wire
    // first for the same physical sample. `accumulate_unlocked_delta` sums
    // rather than overwrites, so a sample that arrives before its absolute
    // counterpart is simply waiting in `PENDING_UNLOCKED_DELTA` when
    // `pass_mouse_move` looks, and is used exactly once.
    //
    // **This is only harmless, not proven harmless, when a relative sample
    // never arrives after its own physical sample's absolute report has
    // already been drained.** If it does -- sample A's `wl_pointer.motion`
    // dispatches, finds nothing pending, and takes the arithmetic fallback;
    // A's own `relative_motion` dispatches afterwards and accumulates; then
    // sample B's `wl_pointer.motion` arrives and drains *A*'s leftover delta
    // instead of computing its own -- A's movement is sent twice (once as its
    // own fallback, once standing in for B) and B's real movement is never
    // sent at all. That is a genuine double count and drop on that one pair
    // of reports, not the "smear" an earlier version of this comment called
    // it: a smear implies the total displacement across reports stays right
    // and only its timing shifts, which is what happens only if *every*
    // sample in a run has its relative event ordered the same way relative to
    // the absolute one, so each report ends up quietly replaying the previous
    // report's delta rather than corrupting an unrelated pair. Nothing here
    // establishes that a real compositor keeps that ordering consistent
    // rather than varying it per sample -- see `input.rs`'s
    // `a_relative_sample_delivered_after_its_own_absolute_report_corrupts_the_next_one`
    // for the failure demonstrated in isolation, and `docs/NEXT.md`'s
    // "Ordering was checked rather than assumed" section, which carries the
    // same correction and the open question of whether this is ever hit in
    // practice. `INFERRED`, in both places, that it has not been.
    //
    // The remaining case — an absolute report with nothing waiting for it at
    // all — covers a warp, a surface enter, and a compositor with no
    // `zwp_relative_pointer_v1` (in which case this function is never called

        // GNOME, where the KWin path below was being taken unconditionally.

        // The KWin workaround it came from is real and stays: KWin acknowledges

        // still lets the physical cursor leave it (KDE bug 463088). Native game
        // windows such as Sober's SDL3 window constrain their xdg_toplevel and
        // do not hit that path.

        // activates a lock on the toplevel only where the pointer is inside the
        // toplevel's *input region*, and Cordial cuts the canvas out of that
        // region so clicks reach the engine's subsurface. A lock requested over

        // The focused Roblox box is an `EditText` on a phone, and an
        // `EditText` consumes Enter: nothing downstream hears a key. On a
        // multi-line box it inserts "\n" into the text, the text is synced,
        // and whatever happens next (a chat script that sends on seeing the
        // newline and empties the box, or a box that simply keeps it) is the
        // engine's, delivered through `onLuaTextBoxChangedCallback` and
        // `input::apply_engine_text`. On a single-line box it is an editor
        // action: the final text is synced and
        // `nativeReturnPressedFromOnScreenKeyboard` tells the engine, which
        // decides whether the box loses focus (`hideKeyboard`) and whether its
        // text clears or stays -- see `connect_editor_activate`.
        //
        // So `editor_consumes_enter` above keeps the raw key from the engine
        // on both paths while a box is focused, and this file neither blurs a
        // box nor clears the editor on Enter itself.
        //
        // **An earlier version swallowed Return in the multi-line widget and
        // sent the engine the raw key instead, and that was the wrong
        // owner.** It fixed one symptom -- GTK's newline overwriting a chat
        // box the engine had just cleared -- by deciding in the host that a
        // multi-line box never keeps its newline, which is the engine's
        // decision per box, and it left single-line boxes with a key the
        // platform never sends them. The control for both is
        // `tools/text-input-e2e.py`'s section 15.
        //
        // What is INFERRED, because no signed-in run has held it: that the
        // engine acts on `nativeReturnPressedFromOnScreenKeyboard` the way it
        // acted on the raw key. A synthetic `fakefocus` box has no engine
        // behind it, so it can show that the call is made once and the key is
        // withheld; it cannot show what a chat box or a search box does next.
        //
        // **Escape and a click outside need no special case here either**, for
        // the same reason the comment above this function gives Escape: both
        // reach the engine as ordinary input (Escape through this same path,
        // an outside click through `dispatch_button`) and it is the engine's
        // `hideKeyboard`/focus-loss handling that decides whether the box
        // blurs.
        //
        // **`returnKeyType`/`manualFocusRelease` (`RawTextBoxInfo`'s slots 11
        // and 12) are read only to be traced, in `input::return_pressed`.** On
        // Android they pick the IME action button and say whether the game,
