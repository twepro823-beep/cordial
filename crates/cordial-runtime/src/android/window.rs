//! A host window, and `ANativeWindow_*` over it.
//!
//! Android hands the engine an `ANativeWindow` and it renders into that. On
//! Linux the equivalent is a window-system surface, so this creates one and
//! implements the ten `ANativeWindow_*` entry points Roblox imports against it.
//!
//! X11 is loaded with `dlopen` rather than linked. Cordial has to run its loader
//! and asset tests on machines with no display at all — CI, containers, a remote
//! shell — and a link-time dependency would make the whole binary refuse to
//! start there. Loading late means "no window" is a runtime condition the caller
//! can handle, which is what it actually is.
//!
//! Wayland is the better long-term target and Roblox's Android build has no
//! opinion either way. X11 first because `eglCreateWindowSurface` takes an
//! `xcb_window_t`/`Window` directly, whereas Wayland needs an `wl_egl_window`
//! and a surface role — more moving parts for the same first frame.

/// arriving from *before* the lock was taken: the pointer is free-roaming
/// right up to the instant a camera-drag button or the engine's own
/// `SetMouseBehavior(LockCenter)` engages the lock, and X11 guarantees event
/// ordering on one connection -- a `MotionNotify` generated before this
/// backend's `XGrabPointer`+`XWarpPointer` request is necessarily delivered
/// no later than that request's own echo, never after it. The version of
/// this function that shipped only ever checked the *immediate* next event:
/// if a stray in-flight motion sample arrived first, it was read as real
/// motion relative to `centre` rather than discarded, and a pointer that
/// happened to be sitting near a window edge -- exactly where a free cursor
/// tends to be right when the user has just clicked something there -- at
/// the instant the lock engaged reported that stale absolute position as a
/// multi-hundred-pixel relative delta in one frame: a one-shot spin, worst
/// at the edges, which is the shape #41 reports and the discriminator its
/// reporter offered.
