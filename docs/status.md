# Status

<!-- description: What works in Cordial today, what is partly working, and what is broken. -->
<!-- icon: gauge -->

Experimental, but playable: sign in, load a game, move around. Install it
expecting rough edges. What changed release by release is on the
[releases page](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/releases) and in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md).

## What works

"Works" means it was observed working, not that it is finished.

| Area | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Loading `libroblox.so` natively | Works | The engine is extracted once and reused; only a new Roblox build re-extracts |
| App shell | Works | Reaches `APP_READY (Landing)` |
| Rendering | Works | Vulkan, on both backends |
| Networking and HTTPS | Works | |
| Loading into an experience | Works | World, avatar and UI render, signed in |
| Engine content store | Works | `RbxStorage` is a real SQLite database; cache hits rise across launches, so assets are not refetched every session |
| Clean shutdown | Works | Full pause, stop and destroy sequence, seen in the engine's own log |
| Signing in | Works | Through Quick Sign-in, a code flow that needs no typing |
| Staying signed in | Works | Cookies and identity are kept in the desktop keyring, not a file |
| Profiles | Works | A chooser above Launch; creates one, and shows a profile another window holds as unavailable |
| Two accounts at once | Works | Two profiles, two instances, side by side; budget about 1.5 GB of memory each ([ADR-012](adr/ADR-012-profiles-and-instances.md)) |
| Keyboard in an experience | Works | WASD, space, the lot |
| Mouse: navigation, buttons, focus | Works | |
| Mouse: turning the camera | Works | Right-drag, using the compositor's unaccelerated delta, so sensitivity does not depend on your desktop mouse settings |
| Scroll wheel | Works | |
| Pointer capture in first person | Works | The cursor stays in the window |
| Typing into text fields | Works | A GTK overlay draws the focused Android field live, with caret movement and Wayland IME preedit |
| Window | Works | libadwaita header bar, engine as a subsurface |
| Fullscreen | Works | F11 acts on the gameplay window, hides the title bar and persists per profile |
| Audio | Works | Sound in an experience, from real play |
| Voice chat | Works | In a real game on the 0.15.0 binary, joined by deep link and the game's own Connect control; details in [voice-dual-response](analysis/voice-dual-response.md) |
| Feral GameMode | Works | Registered while the client runs |
| Asset overlays | Works | Custom textures, sounds and fonts; non-destructive, remove the file and the original returns ([asset-overrides](asset-overrides.md)) |
| Launching from the shell | Works | Finds a build, or explains how to get one |

## What is partly working

| Area | State | What is missing |
|---|---|---|
| Web views (Marketplace, Profile, Communities) | Partly | They render in a signed-in WebKitGTK window and both observed bridge formats reach the engine. More pages need interactive coverage, and a page-specific bridge command can still use engine vocabulary Cordial has not seen |
| Plugins | Partly | Host, broker and per-profile grants enforce every capability. Settings can grant or revoke one, and install or remove a plugin from a local `.tar.zst`. There is no in-app fetch from a remote index, so the marketplace half of the registry is unbuilt ([plugins](plugins.md)) |
| Text entry coverage | Partly | The overlay needs testing across more field types and input methods |
| Pointer-lock portability | Partly | Wayland reports requested/confirmed and target/focus surfaces; X11 now prefers XI2 raw motion and reports `mode=xi2\|warp`. Hyprland and real X11 acceptance runs are still pending, so #41/#56 remain `INFERRED` |
| Frame rate | Unsettled | See below |

### Frame rate

A flat 60 is the engine's own frame target, not a display lock. Measured
2026-10-03 on a 240.001 Hz output with input driven the whole run: the engine
was told the real rate and still held 59.9 presents a second until
`DFIntTaskSchedulerTargetFps` was raised past 60. **Settings → General →
Graphics → Frame rate limit** raises it ([fastflags.md](fastflags.md)); MAILBOX
and FIFO both clear 60 with it set. What that measurement did not cover, and
the older records it replaces, are in
[ADR-044](adr/ADR-044-settings-reach-a-running-game.md).

## What is broken

From the [0.23.2 release notes](releases/v0.23.2.md), the newest list:

- **The signed-in startup freeze is not fixed, but Cordial now restarts a stuck
  start by itself** ([#92](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/92)). When
  the client's log shows it has stopped part-way through starting, Cordial
  stops it, says "Roblox got stuck starting. Restarting it (2 of 3).", and
  starts it again, at most twice per press of Roblox. If all three freeze, it
  says so instead of showing a spinner; pressing Roblox again usually works.
  `CORDIAL_NO_FREEZE_RESTART=1` turns the restart off. Not yet seen to recover
  a real freeze: it has only been run against a recorded freeze log, not against
  a live one.
- **Movement keys sometimes stop working after joining a game**
  ([#29](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/29)). Respawning or re-joining
  brings them back. To report it, start Cordial with `CORDIAL_TRACE_KEYS=1`,
  press W in the stuck state, and paste the `[cordial] key` lines from the
  terminal: `flatpak run --env=CORDIAL_TRACE_KEYS=1 io.github.luohoa97.Cordial`,
  or `CORDIAL_TRACE_KEYS=1 cordial` for a native install. `result=ok` on
  `path=native` means the key reached the engine; `result=gated` means Cordial
  dropped it because the window had no keyboard focus. Every key is printed,
  including ones typed into a password box, so trim the paste to the W lines.
- **A touchscreen can crash the client**
  ([#36](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/36)).
- **A Roblox version released only for ARM64 is not shown on x86_64 machines.**
- **Some games show the mobile (touch) interface.**

The rest of the list in the
[0.23.0 notes](releases/v0.23.0.md) still applies.

## Not tested

- **NVIDIA GPUs.** Two users' reports so far: driver 610.57 in the Flatpak
  (2026-10-01, fullscreen in and out held), and an RTX 4070 on 615.71.09
  (2026-10-03, natively), which booted and rendered and got through one
  resize and fullscreen session, with one SIGSEGV at startup in eight launches.
  MAILBOX presented 59.9 a second on a 240 Hz output at the engine's default
  target. Unverified on hybrid laptops and on 535/550; see
  [NVIDIA graphics](nvidia.md).
- **Real ARM64 hardware.** See [Architectures](multiarch.md).
- **The AppImage's web view on a machine without WebKitGTK**, and on anything but
  Fedora. See [Installing Cordial](install.md).
