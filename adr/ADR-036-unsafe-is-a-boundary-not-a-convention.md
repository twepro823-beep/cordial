title: "ADR-036: The unsafe/safe boundary is a lint, not a convention"
---
**Status:** Accepted, 2026-09-16

## Context

`unsafe` in this workspace was already concentrated in two crates by
convention: `cordial-runtime` and `cordial-linker-sys` are where Roblox's
`libroblox.so` calls into Cordial with raw pointers and where Cordial calls
back into the bionic linker, and the other three crates were supposed to stay
clean of it. Nothing enforced that. A textual count on `main` before this
change:

```text
crate                unsafe sites   SAFETY comments
cordial-runtime          542            276
cordial-linker-sys       111             97
cordial-shell             15             10
cordial-plugins            1              1
cordial-update              1              0
```

`cordial-plugins` and `cordial-update` each carried exactly one `unsafe`
block, both raw libc calls that had nothing to do with the ABI edge --
`libc::flock` for an advisory lock and `libc::kill(-pid, SIGKILL)` for a
sandboxed process group. Nobody put them there to touch memory unsafely; they
were reached for because they were the obvious way to make one syscall, in a
crate whose header comment says nothing about a boundary the two lines then
quietly crossed. A convention nobody checks is a convention that erodes one
syscall at a time, and the only thing that would have stopped either line
landing was a compiler that refused to build it.

## Decision

**`unsafe_code` is `deny` at the workspace level, and every one of the five
member crates opts in with `[lints]\nworkspace = true`.** `cordial-runtime`
and `cordial-linker-sys` each carry their own crate-root
`#![allow(unsafe_code)]`, with a comment saying why, at every compilation
unit that needs it -- that means both the library and, for `cordial-runtime`,
the `cordial-run` binary's own crate root in `src/bin/load.rs`, since the
lint attribute has to be present at each crate root a `[lints]` table covers.

`cordial-shell` also carries the allow, but for a narrower reason than the
other two -- see "`cordial-shell` is not a third ABI-edge crate" below.
`cordial-plugins` and `cordial-update` carry `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`,
stronger than a bare `deny`: a `forbid` cannot be locally overridden by a
`#[allow(unsafe_code)]` on some future function, so reopening either crate to
unsafe code takes deleting a line that names this ADR, which is a change a
reviewer will actually see.

## Why a lint, not a convention

A convention is enforced by whoever remembers to look, and this codebase has
already shown that nobody reliably does -- both stray sites in
`cordial-plugins` and `cordial-update` passed review. A lint is enforced by
the compiler on every build, including one run by someone who has never read
this ADR. That is the entire difference this change makes: nothing about
*where* unsafe code is allowed changes, only who is responsible for noticing
when it appears somewhere it should not.

## Why the Asterinas model does not map here

Asterinas and similar frameworks push `unsafe` down to a thin kernel of
primitives and build everything else, including the interface an untrusted
caller sees, out of safe code on top -- the unsafety is *underneath* the
public surface, hidden from a caller who never has to see it.

That model assumes the boundary between safe and unsafe is one this project
gets to draw. It is not, here. `libroblox.so` is not a caller Cordial exposes
a safe API to -- it is calling *into* Cordial's stub table with raw pointers
and expecting particular ABI-shaped answers back, because it was built for
Android's ART and JNI, not for anything Cordial designed. The unsafety at
that edge is not an implementation detail Cordial chose to hide beneath a
safe wrapper; it **is** the interface, dictated by a binary Cordial did not
write and is contractually barred from modifying (see AGENTS.md's rule
against touching Roblox code). A safe wrapper around `symtab::build`'s stub
table would still need, underneath it, exactly the same raw pointer
dereferences this ADR is not trying to make disappear -- the choice is
between naming that plainly at the crate that does it, or hiding it one layer
further down and calling the outer layer clean.

## `cordial-shell` is not a third ABI-edge crate, but it is not zero either

`cordial-shell`'s 15 unsafe sites are not ABI-edge unsafe in the sense the
two crates above are -- nothing in it exists because Roblox is calling in.
But three real things do belong there and have no safe wrapper available:
`audio_devices.rs` calls the one C ABI `native/pipewire_backend.h` exposes,
so the settings window can enumerate audio sinks the same way the client
enumerates them, without a second implementation of "list the sinks" to
disagree with the first (see that module's own header). `profile.rs` takes
ADR-012's advisory lock on a profile directory with `flock`/`fcntl` and signals
a launched client with `kill`, all on raw fds and a raw pid, because that is
what an advisory process lock is made of. `host_window.rs` sets
`GDK_BACKEND` before GTK reads it, which `glib` marks unsafe because
`setenv` racing a concurrent `getenv` is undefined behaviour on the C side of
that call, not because Rust is doing anything unusual.

None of it is memory-unsafe Rust hiding behind an `unsafe` marker to avoid a
lint; all of it is a syscall or an extern call with no safe wrapper in this
tree. Rewriting fifteen call sites through a hand-rolled safe shim, just so
`cordial-shell` could carry `forbid` like the other two, would be exactly the
churn the next section rejects, at a tenth of the scale. `cordial-shell`
therefore gets the same `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` treatment as the two ABI-edge
crates, with its own comment explaining the narrower reason, rather than the
`forbid` given to `cordial-plugins` and `cordial-update` once their one stray
site each was removed.

## Why the two strays were fixed with `rustix`, not moved to a new crate

One alternative considered for the two stray sites was giving them a home
of their own -- a small crate for "syscalls other crates need," so
`cordial-plugins` and `cordial-update` could `forbid(unsafe_code)` without
touching the calls themselves. That was rejected: it moves two lines of
`unsafe` into a place chosen for the sake of a lint working. Nothing about
`libc::flock` or `libc::kill(-pid, SIGKILL)` was any easier to review, verify
or maintain in a crate whose only reason to exist was one function each. It
would have been a diff that made the "0 sites" table entry technically true
and left the actual work no more scrutinised than before -- churn for a
cosmetic win, and this workspace has enough real unsafe surface without
manufacturing a crate to hold two lines nobody will ever look at again.

`rustix` was already resolved into `Cargo.lock` at version 1.1.4, pulled in
transitively by `async-io`, `async-process`, `async-signal`, `polling`, `tempfile`
and `zbus` -- so making `cordial-plugins` and `cordial-update` direct users of it
adds a dependency edge, not a second copy of one to build or audit.
`rustix::fs::flock` wraps the same `flock(2)` `provider::exclusive` was already
calling, turning the C `-1`-on-failure convention into an `Err` with no `unsafe`
block left at the call site. `rustix::process::kill_process_group` wraps the same
`kill(-pid, sig)` `Plugin::kill` was already calling -- it takes the *positive*
pid and negates it internally, so the exact process-group semantics that
justify the negative pid in the first place (see `host.rs`'s own comment on why
a single `SIGKILL` to the child alone is not enough) are preserved without this
crate spelling out the negation itself.

## Why not `std::fs::File::try_lock`

`std::fs::File::try_lock` does the same `flock(2)` with no extra dependency at
all, and would have been the simpler fix. It stabilised in Rust 1.89. This
workspace pins `rust-version = "1.75"` in the root `Cargo.toml`, deliberately:
`.github/workflows/release.yml` carries comments at the AppImage and Flatpak
build steps explaining that the Flatpak runtime this ships against trails
current stable, and breaking that pin to remove one `unsafe` block is a worse
trade than keeping a small, already-present dependency. If the Flatpak
runtime's baseline ever moves past 1.89, `try_lock` becomes the better choice
and this is the ADR that should be updated to say so.

## What is a lint and what is a ratchet

Three lints, one of them workspace-wide policy and two of them measured
against what `main` actually contained on 2026-09-16 rather than picked in
advance:

**`unsafe_code = "deny"`** at the workspace level, per crate carve-outs as
above. This is the actual boundary and is not a ratchet.

**`clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "warn"`.** `cargo clippy --workspace
--all-targets -- -W clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` (with
`-A clippy::not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref`, see below) found **190** unsafe blocks
across the workspace with no `SAFETY:` comment above them -- almost all in
`cordial-runtime` and `cordial-linker-sys`, which is what accumulates when
`unsafe` is merged with no lint checking for a comment. That gap does not
close in one change, so this starts at `warn`: a number to bring
down, not a target already met. `tools/unsafe-audit.py --clippy` reports the
current count on demand; `tools/unsafe-audit.py` alone gives a fast,
build-free approximation for a quick check between clippy runs.

**`unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn = "deny"`.** This lint requires every raw operation
inside an `unsafe fn` body to sit in its own nested `unsafe { }` block, rather
than treating the whole body as implicitly unsafe (edition 2024 makes that
the default; edition 2021, which this workspace is on, does not). Set to
`"deny"` and built before fixing anything, it found **16** real sites, all in
`cordial-runtime` -- `cordial-linker-sys`, `cordial-shell`, `cordial-plugins`
and `cordial-update` had none. That is a small, entirely mechanical diff, not
the hundreds a workspace with roughly 650 unsafe sites might suggest: most
`unsafe fn` bodies here already wrapped their raw operations in an inner
`unsafe {}` out of habit, and the 16 that had not were fixed in this change
rather than deferred. **This is the opposite of what was expected going in**
-- the task briefing for this change assumed turning the lint on "may
produce a large diff across 542 sites" and asked that the diff be measured
before committing to a level; measured, it was small enough to fix outright,
so `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn` is `"deny"`, not a ratchet.

## A pre-existing clippy failure, fixed

Getting either clippy measurement above required `-A clippy::not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref`.
Without it, `cargo clippy --workspace` did not complete at all: `cordial-linker-sys`
alone had 50 public functions clippy reported as "might dereference a raw
pointer but is not marked `unsafe`", and `not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref` is in
clippy's `correctness` group, which is deny-by-default -- so it stopped the
whole workspace's clippy run before `cordial-runtime` or `cordial-shell`, both
of which depend on `cordial-linker-sys`, were even reached. This is now fixed,
on branch `clippy-correctness`.

**The fix is the pattern this ADR already argues for: `unsafe fn` plus a
`# Safety` doc, not a handle newtype.** All 50 functions take a resolved JNI
native (`native`/`f`: `*mut c_void`) that every call site already stores as a
raw `usize` in its own long-lived state -- a bootstrap plan in `load.rs`, an
`AtomicPtr` in `input.rs`, a `OnceLock` elsewhere -- and re-casts at each
call. A newtype would have to live in that storage to buy anything, which
means rewriting the zero-checks and struct fields around 84 call sites rather
than just marking the call unsafe: a behaviour-risking diff for a change that
is supposed to be type/contract-only. `crates/cordial-linker-sys/src/lib.rs`'s
own header comment carries the full reasoning. Every one of the 84 call
sites in `cordial-runtime` now wraps the call in `unsafe { }` with a `//
SAFETY:` comment naming where the pointer was resolved.

**Fixing it surfaced two things nobody had been able to see before, because
nothing had ever gotten this far.** With `cordial-linker-sys` compiling,
clippy reached `cordial-runtime` for the first time under this exact
invocation and found:

- **Two more `correctness`-group errors**, `clippy::eq_op` in
  `android/capture.rs`'s CRC-32 implementation and `clippy::never_loop` in
  `browser_tracker.rs`'s cookie-header parser. Neither was a logic bug on
  inspection. The `eq_op` site, `0xffff_ffff ^ 0xffff_ffff`, is verified
  correct against the standard CRC-32/ISO-HDLC check value
  (`crc32(b"123456789") == 0xcbf4_3926`) -- it is just an obfuscated way to
  write the constant it reduces to, and now says so. The `never_loop` site's
  `for` loop over `;`-separated `Set-Cookie` parts always returned or broke on
  its first iteration by design (only the first pair is the cookie; the rest
  are attributes), so it is now a direct `.next()` instead of a loop shaped
  like one.
- **13 more `not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref` instances inside `cordial-runtime`
  itself** -- not part of the 50 above, and invisible to every prior clippy
  run because the build never got past `cordial-linker-sys` to reach them.
  Four follow the same "native resolved from `libroblox.so`" contract as the
  first 50: `cookies::probe`, `cookies::restore` and `identity::push_user_id`
  are now `unsafe fn` with the same doc pattern, and their three call sites
  wrap accordingly. Two are the opposite direction -- `cookies::observe_host`
  and `identity::observe_login` are sinks `native/cookies.cpp` and
  `native/android_classes.cpp` call *into* Rust with a raw `*const c_char` --
  and are now `unsafe extern "C" fn`; marking a C-called callback `unsafe`
  changes nothing about its ABI, but it does mean the function-pointer types
  it is registered through (`cookies_register_handler`'s `sink` parameter,
  `identity_set_sinks`'s `on_login`) had to move from `extern "C" fn(...)` to
  `unsafe extern "C" fn(...)` to keep passing it as a value. The remaining
  seven are `cordial-runtime`'s from-scratch bionic pthread shim in
  `bionic/pthread.rs` (`cond_init`, `cond_wait`, `cond_timedwait`, `once`,
  `key_create`, `setspecific`) -- also C-called, also now `unsafe extern "C"
  fn`, registered into the same `$fn as *const () as *mut c_void` table
  `bionic::function_overrides` uses, which does not care whether the function
  item is `unsafe`.

**The `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` count is unchanged: 190 before, 190
after**, both numbers from `tools/unsafe-audit.py --clippy` (the "before" run
needed `-A clippy::not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref` added back in to reach the same
crates; the "after" run needed no flag at all, which is the fix working).
Getting this far also let clippy reach `cordial-runtime`'s `cordial-run`
binary target for the first time, which surfaced two more pre-existing gaps
in `bin/load.rs` (`cordial_local_storage_set`'s `slice::from_raw_parts` and
`cordial_local_storage_delete`'s `borrow_str` call, both untouched by this
change otherwise) that would otherwise have pushed the total to 192. Those
two got a `SAFETY:` comment each, matching their neighbours in the same
`impl`, so this change is neutral on the ratchet rather than the one that
happened to make it visible. The rest of the 190 -- almost all pre-existing,
almost all in `cordial-runtime` and `cordial-linker-sys` -- is
[issue #55](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/55)'s to pay down.

## A worked example of the FFI-edge pattern, not a rewrite of it

`cordial-runtime` has roughly 350 `extern "C"` functions, most of them
`libroblox.so`'s call-in surface. Auditing all of them to validate every raw
pointer, convert to `&CStr`/slices at the boundary, and delegate to a safe
inner function is real work worth doing, and far too large to fold into a
lints change. Three call sites that all reimplemented the same "borrow a
request string, write a response back into a caller buffer" shape --
`linking::on_open_url`, `permissions::reply`, and `webview::on_open_window`
-- were converted to share `ffi_util::borrow_request` and
`ffi_util::write_response` instead of each open-coding the same null check,
`CStr::from_ptr` and length-checked `copy_nonoverlapping`. That is the pattern
this ADR asks the rest of the crate to follow incrementally: see
[issue #55](https://github.com/luohoa97/cordial/issues/55) for the rest of it.

## Consequences

A crate outside the two (or, narrowly, three) named here that adds an
`unsafe` block now fails to build, with an error naming exactly which lint
and which line, rather than passing review because nobody happened to look.
`cordial-plugins` and `cordial-update` cannot reopen without a code change
that has to explain itself against this ADR by name. `cordial-runtime` and
`cordial-linker-sys` keep the unsafe surface the ABI edge actually requires,
now with a documented, ratcheting count of how much of it lacks a SAFETY
comment, and a script that reports that count on demand instead of by hand.
