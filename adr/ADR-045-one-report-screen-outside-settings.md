title: "ADR-045: One report screen, outside Settings, and a notice on X11"
---
**Status:** accepted
**Date:** 2026-09-30
**Related:** [ADR-011](/adr/ADR-011-wayland-and-libadwaita), [ADR-024](/adr/ADR-024-x11-is-supported-again), [ADR-030](/adr/ADR-030-reports-arrive-from-discord)

## Decision

1. **The diagnostics block lives on one screen, `report.rs`, titled "Report a
   Problem".** It has the block, Copy, Save to a file, and a link to the issue
   form. It replaces Settings' Report page and the About dialog's
   Troubleshooting page, which showed the same `diagnostics::report()` text
   and were found separately or not at all.
2. **It is an `AdwDialog` of its own, not the About dialog's Troubleshooting
   page.** `AdwAboutDialog` cannot be opened on a chosen page, and the
   launcher's X11 notice has to land exactly here. The About dialog no longer
   sets `debug_info`. Its "Report an Issue" row is intercepted with
   `activate-link` and opens this screen instead of the web form; the row
   keeps libadwaita's external-link icon, which is not quite true.
3. **Settings holds settings.** Its pages are Roblox, Updates, Version, General,
   Plugins and FastFlags. Report was the one page that was not a setting.
   The entry points are the main menu's "Report a Problem", the About dialog,
   and the launcher notice.
4. **The launcher shows a notice when the game will open on X11.** An
   `AdwBanner`: "X11 support is buggy. If something goes wrong, try Wayland."
   with a Report a Problem button. "Will open on X11" is the loader's own rule,
   `cordial_runtime::android::backend()`: `CORDIAL_X11` set, or no
   `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. `x11_notice::uses_x11` repeats it over the same two
   variables, and the two must be changed together. (Since the doctor states
   the same rule, `x11_notice::uses_x11` calls `doctor::uses_x11` in the
   library; the loader's copy is the one left to keep in step.) It is deliberately not "the
   launcher's GDK display is X11": a session exporting `GDK_BACKEND=x11` over a
   Wayland compositor runs the game on Wayland.

## Rejected

**A link inside the banner text.** `AdwBanner` exposes no `activate-link`, so a
link would have opened a web page or needed a walk of the banner's internal
widgets. The banner's button is the libadwaita way to attach an action.

## Not verified

Under real X11 the launcher was not photographed: Xwayland would not start in
the nested compositor used here (`/tmp/.X11-unix` not owned by the user inside
the container). The banner was shown with `CORDIAL_X11=1` on Wayland, which
takes the same branch; the no-`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` branch is covered by a unit test
of `uses_x11` only.

## Added 2026-09-30

The screen also carries the doctor's checks under "This machine", and Copy and
Save include them. They are asked on a worker, without the network, so the
screen opens at once; the text Copy hands over is the block alone until they
finish. See [`docs/doctor.md`](/doctor).
