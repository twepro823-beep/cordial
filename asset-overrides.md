Roblox's app carries its own textures, fonts and interface images. An **asset
override** is a file of yours that Cordial serves in place of one of them: a
different cursor, a font you can read more easily, a recoloured button.

Cordial never edits Roblox's files. When the game asks for one of its
built-in assets, Cordial checks your overrides first and hands over your file
if there is one. Delete your file and the original comes back, with nothing to
repair.

<Note>

Overrides replace files that ship inside the app. They cannot change assets a
game downloads from Roblox's servers, such as a game's own maps, models or
decals.

</Note>

## Adding an override

<Steps>
<Step title="Find the file you want to replace">


Overrides mirror the folder layout of the `assets/` directory inside
Roblox's Android app. For example, the mouse cursor is
`content/textures/Cursors/KeyboardMouse/ArrowCursor.png`, and the fonts
are under `content/fonts/`.


</Step>
<Step title="Put your file at the same path in the override folder">


| Install | Override folder |
|---|---|
| Flatpak | `~/.var/app/io.github.luohoa97.Cordial/config/cordial/overlay/` |
| Other installs | `~/.config/cordial/overlay/` |

So a replacement cursor goes at
`~/.config/cordial/overlay/content/textures/Cursors/KeyboardMouse/ArrowCursor.png`.
Keep the original file name and format.


</Step>
<Step title="Start Roblox again">


Cordial reads the overrides at launch. A change made while the game is
running applies the next time you start it.


</Step>
</Steps>

This folder applies to every profile. Set `CORDIAL_OVERLAY` to use a different
folder.

## Sharing overrides as a plugin

A plugin can carry an `overlay/` folder laid out the same way. That is the way
to share a texture or font pack: it needs no code, so it installs from
**Settings → Plugins → Install from a file** without asking for any
permissions, and it can be switched on and off per profile like any other
plugin.

```text
my-cursor-pack/
├── plugin.json
└── overlay/
    └── content/textures/Cursors/KeyboardMouse/ArrowCursor.png
```

```json plugin.json
{
  "id": "my-cursor-pack",
  "name": "My cursor pack",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "capabilities": []
}
```

If two sources replace the same file, your own override folder wins over every
plugin.

## Bloxstrap mods

Bloxstrap's mods are made for the Windows client, whose files are laid out
differently. Cursor and font mods carry over unchanged. A file whose path does
not exist in the Android app is simply never asked for, so a mod that has no
effect usually means its files do not match a path inside the Android app's
`assets/` folder.

## Limits

- **Only the app's built-in assets.** Overrides cover files under `assets/`
  in the Android app, and nothing else.
- **Applied at launch.** Changing an override, or switching an override plugin
  on or off, takes effect at the next start.
- **Your responsibility.** Cordial does not check what a replacement changes.
  Swapping something that affects gameplay rather than looks is on you, and
  Roblox's rules apply to it as they would to anything else.
- **Nothing is drawn over the game.** Overrides replace files; Cordial does not
  inject an overlay into the game's picture.
